# Yagi
Data processing of Yagi's donations

There are several files here:
- get_yagi_data.py: scrawl data and save to CSV after each 50 pages
- plot_yagi.py: process data from CSV and over-write data in plot_yagi.html
- plot_yagi.html: show data dynamically + search box

NOTE: only some pages are scrawled and shown in the html.
